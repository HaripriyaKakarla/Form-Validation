## Introduction

This project is a form validation system that ensures user inputs meet specific criteria before submission. It includes a well-designed user interface with real-time feedback for fields such as Name, Email, Phone Number, Password, and Confirm Password.

## Features

- **Name Validation**: Checks for minimum character length and provides feedback.
- **Email Validation**: Ensures the email contains a single `@`, does not start or end with `@`, and is properly formatted.
- **Phone Number Validation**: Verifies that the phone number is exactly 10 digits long.
- **Password Validation**: Ensures the password is between 8-20 characters, does not contain spaces, and is not a common password.
- **Confirm Password Validation**: Matches the confirm password field with the original password.
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback with visual indicators for valid and invalid inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the form.
- **CSS**: For styling the form and validation feedback.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing form validation logic and user interaction.
- **BootStrap**: For real-time valid and invalid feedbacks and for styling the components.
